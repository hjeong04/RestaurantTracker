# Gradebook Application

## Application Proposal

This application allows the users to manage and view the record of their students' grades. 
Users will be able to:
- create a *list* of their students
- create an *assignment* tab to record each student's grade
- create a *quiz/test* tab to record each student's grade
- view each of the *student's records* including their assignments and test grades 

This application will be used by  **teachers** who are in need of a simple program to keep track of all the marks 
for numerous assignments and tests they assigned to their students. 

This project is an interest to me because as a student wanting to become a teacher, I have taught a small number of 
students through my volunteering opportunities. During those times, I have always wondered how highschool teachers keep 
track of all the grades for assignments and tests that are assigned throughout the year of their 100+ students. I 
realized that organizational tools such as a gradebook application would be an essential teaching tool. In hopes of 
using such application in the future as a teacher, I decided to create my own.
